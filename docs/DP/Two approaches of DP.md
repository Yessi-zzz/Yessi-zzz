### Memoization
- Top-down approach
- Stores the results of function calls in a table.
- **Recursive** implementation
- Entries are filled when needed.
### Tabulation
- Bottom-up approach
- Stores the results of subproblems in a table
- **Iterative** implementation
- Entries are filled in a bottom-up manner from the smallest size to the final size.
